## Node Modules

Like most other modern languages, Node is modular. In essence, if a file puts something inside of module.exports, it can be made available for use in any other file using `require()`.

The module.exports or exports is a special object which is included in every JS file in the Node.js application by default.
module is a variable that represents current module and exports is an object that will be exposed as a module.

As mentioned above, exports is an object. So it exposes whatever you assigned to it as a module. For example, if you assign a string literal then it will expose that string literal as a module.

```js
// my-module.js
module.exports = 'hello world'
```

```js
// app.js
const message = require('./my-module.js')
console.log(message)
```

exports is an object. So, you can attach properties or methods to it.

```js
exports.helloMessage = 'Hello world'
```

You can also attach an object to module.exports as shown below.

```js
module.exports = {
  firstName: 'Bill',
  lastName: 'Preston Esq',
}
```

For example, lets make two files: `touch my-module.js main.js`

```js
// my-module.js
const number = 7
module.exports.name = 'Kenaniah'
module.exports.arr = [1, 2, 3]
module.exports.getNumber = function() {
  console.log('Get number called. Returning: ', number)
  return number
}

console.log('End of my-module.js file')
```

```js
// main.js

// here we're grabbing everything that's "exported" in our other file, and storing it a variable called 'my'
const my = require('./my-module')

// Variables and such that were not exported aren't in scope
console.log('number is ' + typeof number) // undefined

// Anything exported can be accessed on the object
console.log('Name is: ', my.name)

// Closures are still closures
console.log('The number is: ' + my.getNumber())

// JavaScript is still JavaScript
console.log('The array contains ' + my.arr.length + ' elements')

// Let's see the module we imported
console.log(my)
```

Then try running:

```
node my-module.js
node main.js
```
